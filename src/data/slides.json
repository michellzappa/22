            "notes": "I first encountered the Tarot in 2016, early in my own leadership journey. I had started Envisioning only a few years earlier, and always considered myself skeptical to everything mystical.\nRegardless of my doubts, I ended up getting into Tarot a few years later. First by studying the cards, but then mostly by carrying a deck of Tarot cards around and offering my read to just about everyone I spent time with. One of the first things you learn when reading for others is how powerful the experience can be for both of you. After reading for someone I would always ask them if the interpretation made sense, and 100% of the people I read for said it not only made sense but was genuinely insightful for them. Around the same time, I made it a habit to pull cards for myself whenever I felt something required insight. It was a Thursday in early December 2021 when I pulled the Tower card for myself. We'll come back to the deeper meaning of this card later, but in short, it's the archetype that symbolizes disruptive change and unexpected certainties coming crashing down. Feeling this was serious, i posted the instagram story you see on the slide and braced myself for the unknown. The following day, my business partner of eight years came to me and explained they were finally leaving the company because our financial situation was untenable. After the weekend, on Monday, another business partner came to me with the same message. Both the conversations were overdue, but I can't help to see them from the perspective of having pulled the Tower."

This principle suggests that the same patterns and laws that govern the cosmos (the Above) are reflected in the individual human being (the Below). You can use this slide to highlight how the journey through the Major Arcana, representing the Fool's path to enlightenment, mirrors the larger journey of the soul through the universe. \n The Inner and Outer Worlds: The mirrored image of the forest can symbolize the reflection of the inner world (thoughts, emotions, and experiences) in the outer world (actions, relationships, and circumstances). You could emphasize that self-knowledge and transformation occur on both an internal and external level. The journey of the Fool is not merely a symbolic one but a process of actively shaping one's life and reality. \n The Integration of Opposites: The concept of As Above, So Below also suggests the integration of opposites, such as light and darkness, masculine and feminine, spirit and matter. The Tarot itself embodies this principle, with cards representing a spectrum of human experiences and archetypes. You can discuss how the Fool's journey involves confronting and integrating these polarities to achieve wholeness and balance."
